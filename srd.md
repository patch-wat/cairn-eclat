Éclat is a [cairnhack](https://cairnrpg.com/) set in a vaguely early modern period within a magipunk multiverse. The long-term and widespread use of sentient magic, achieved by exposing a particular species of jellyfish to human dreams, once ushered in an unprecedented age of prosperity. These magics are now ancient, and humanity has spread across a multitude of dimensions. Now, they bathe every aspect of the human condition, from work to prayer to liesure, and even to people's own biology. 

For millennia, the Tynic Empire has reigned supreme over the known Geos. However, amidst a centuries-long interregnum, whispers of "Siggerick the Last" now echo throughout the land, signifying a shift in power. The once-clear magics used to foretell the future have become shrouded in fog, leaving the Imperial Princesses unable to choose a successor from among the myriad warlords who have emerged from once-peaceful worlds.

As new political factions and cults proliferate like wildfire, uncertainty grips the populace. Will these turbulent times give rise to new utopias, or will they merely result in the ashes of once-great civilizations?

## Overview

**Éclat** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### Neutrality
The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Classless
A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.

### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

### Fiction First
Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

### Growth
Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

### Principles
The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.
