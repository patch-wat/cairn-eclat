Éclat is an [cairnhack](https://cairnrpg.com/) set in a vaguely early modern period magipunk multiverse. Longterm and widespread use of sentient magic, caused by exposing a particular species of jellyfish to human dreams. By this point the magic used to travel between earths is ancient. The Tynic Empire has for millenia ruled the known Geos, but now, during a centuries long interregnum, people now whisper the name of Siggerick LVI as Siggerick the Last. The magics used to read the future, which were once so clear, are now foggy, and the Imperial Princesses cannot select a replacement from among the myriad warlords who sprout like weeds from once peaceful worlds. New politics and new cults spread like wildfire, and people wonder if from the coals will rise new utopias or if it will simply settle into ashes.

## Overview

**Éclat** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### Neutrality
The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Classless
A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.

### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

### Fiction First
Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

### Growth
Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

### Principles
The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.
