Ã‰clat is an [cairnhack](https://cairnrpg.com/) set in a vaguely early modern period magipunk multiverse. Longterm and widespread use of sentient magic, caused by exposing a particular speicies of jellyfish to human dreams. By this point the magic used to travel between earths is ancient. The Tynic Empire has for millenia ruled the known Geos, but now, during a centuries long interregnum, people now whisper the name of Siggerick LVI as Siggerick the Last. The magics used to read the future, which were once so clear, are now foggy, and the Imperial Princesses cannot select a replacement from among the myriad warlords who sprout like weeds from once peaceful worlds. New politics and new cults spread like wildfire, and people wonder if from the coals will rise new utopias or if it will simply settle into ashes.
