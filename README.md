Ã‰clat is a [cairnhack](https://cairnrpg.com/) set in a vaguely early modern period within a magipunk multiverse. The long-term and widespread use of sentient magic, achieved by exposing a particular species of jellyfish to human dreams, once ushered in an unprecedented age of prosperity. These magics are now ancient, and humanity has spread across a multitude of dimensions. Now, they bathe every aspect of the human condition, from work to prayer to liesure, and even to people's own biology. 

For millennia, the Tynic Empire has reigned supreme over the known Geos. However, amidst a centuries-long interregnum, whispers of "Siggerick the Last" now echo throughout the land, signifying a shift in power. The once-clear magics used to foretell the future have become shrouded in fog, leaving the Imperial Princesses unable to choose a successor from among the myriad warlords who have emerged from once-peaceful worlds.

As new political factions and cults proliferate like wildfire, uncertainty grips the populace. Will these turbulent times give rise to new utopias, or will they merely result in the ashes of once-great civilizations?
