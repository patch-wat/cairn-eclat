# Mutations
### Overview
Mutations are magical deformities to the body and/or soul of a person that have applications beyond merely cosmetic changes.

### Acquiring Mutations
Messing with your phenotype beyond the boundaries of what heaven extended is both costly and draining and requires the services of a  **Mutagenist**. It generally costs a point of WIL, 500gp and an additional 500gp for each mutation you already posses.

You may also gain mutations either randomly or as a result of the fiction. This is typically caused by exposure to raw and wild magic

### Random Mutations (d20)
1. Illusionary Afterimage - A shadowy image overlays your features but slightly offset. Can have it temporarily subtract 1 from damage for a fatigue. It occasionally falls out of sync.
2. Carapace - Your skin is naturally armored. +1 armor, but finding a tailor is a nightmare
3. Ghost Hand - Can operate things from a distance, but the hand is cowardly
4. Extra limbs - Can treat a bulky item as regular
5. Witches eyes - Can see normally hidden things, but occasionally sees what is spiritually true instead of just physical truths
6. Poison immunity - Poison adds 1d4 fatigue instead of other effects
7. Perfect Body control - Can perfectly coordinate your body in space but formerly subconscious actions require conscious effort
8. Fast Healing - You heal substantially faster but need more provisions
9. Spell Eater - You can eat a magic effect rather than a provision. It's very filling but causes heartburn.
10. Beast Speak - you can talk with animals. Be warned that they never shut up.
11. Adrenal Control - You can regulate your adrenaline. You can choose to go first in exchange for gaining a fatigue.
12. Enhanced hearing - You gain incredibly good hearing.
13. Natural weapon - Your fists (or whatever you replace them with) does 1d6. 
14. Slimy Skin - Your skin is very slippery. Must be kept moist.
15. Wild Genome - Your other mutations have a chance to further mutate (see spell mutation).
16. Plant Skin - Time spent in sunlight can offset food needs. Vulnerable to fire and bothered by bees.
17. Winged - You can fly.
18. Magical Sense - You can more easily sense when magic is afoot.
19. Stone Swim - you can swim in stone
20. Quills - Occasionally deal back 1d4 damage when attacked in melee
