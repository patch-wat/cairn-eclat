# Magimorphosis
Spells, at their fundamental nature, are thoughts without bodies. Just as all spells are, to a much lesser extant than a human, sentient, they are able to grow and change, especially when put under sufficient stress. When a magic spell from a Grimjelly is cast under stressful or dangerous conditions, it might _change_. This process is called **Magimorphosis**

### Grimjelly (Mutate Spell)
This process can be triggered on a spell in a grimjelly by casting a spell of _Mutate Spell_

### Morph Mutations
This same process can also apply to [Mutations](/srd/magic/mutations.md). Typically, this is at GM discretion but is made more likely by the presence of certain other mutations.

## Procedure
When a spell or mutation morphs, either by the fiction or by magic, roll twice on the [Basic Adaptions](#basic-adaptions-d100) table. Results not on the table or that cannot be feasibly applied to the magic do nothing.

### Grand Adaptations
When purposefully morphing a spell, the player may choose to permanently break an item that takes up at least one slot in their inventory. The item must also be valuable, either to the spell or to the character. To gain something, something of equal value must be lost. If they do, instead of rolling twice on the [Basic Adaptions](#basic-adaptions-d100) table, they roll once on it and once on the Grand Adaptations depending on what they're attempting to morph, either a [spell in a Grimjelly](#grand-adaptions-grimjelly-d6) or a [mutation on a creature](#grand-adaptions-mutation-d6)


#### Basic Adaptions (d100)

|9-10| Improved Applicability|  The spell affects a broader category of targets. charm person becomes charm  |
|11| Self-Healing | If the spell would cause a __Fatigue__ it has a 1/4 chance of not doing so|
|12| Portability | It looses the __bulky__ tag. Otherwise, if you carry another Grimjelly, this spell's becomes _petty_. If it's a mutation, it doesn't count towards the cost of adding new mutations |
|13| Chaining | If it hits a target, the spell has a 1/4 chance of jumping to a new target |

|31| Hungry | spell requires a specialized item to use. Item must take up at least 1 inventory slot|
|32| Resistible | Unwilling targets can make a save to resist the effects. A resisted spell might have a lesser effect (e.g. half damage), or might be completely ignored |
|33| Slothful | This spell takes some time to go into effect, typically at the start of the next round |
|34| Exhausting | This spell gives additional __Fatigue__|
|35| Maddening | This spell does 1d4 WIL damage to you upon casting. Cannot cause critical damage |
