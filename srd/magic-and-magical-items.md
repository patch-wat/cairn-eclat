# Magic and Magical Items
## Grimoire Jellyfish
**Grimoire Jellyfish** (or **Grimjellies**) are a living creatures found on deep in the oceans of certain worlds. Repeatedly exposing a **Grimjelly** to dreams will allow them to replicate a magical effect.

Each **Grimjelly** contain a single spell and take up one slot. It takes years to grow one with sufficient magical power to grow manifest a spell.

**Grimjellies** sometimes display unusual properties or limitations, such as producing a foul or unearthly smell when opened, possessing an innate intelligence, or working only when held in moonlight.

**Grimjellies** will attract the attention of those who seek the arcane power within, and it is considered dangerous to display them openly.

**Scrolls**, made from their ink are similar to **Grimjellies**, however:
- They do not take up an inventory slot.
- They do not cause fatigue.
- They disappear after one use.

## Casting Spells
Anyone can cast a spell by holding a **Grimjelly** in both hands and reading its contents aloud. They must then add a Fatigue to inventory, occupying one slot. Given time and safety, PCs can _enhance_ a spell's impact (e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without any additional cost. If the PC is deprived or in danger, the Warden may require a PC to make a WIL save to avoid any ill-effects from casting the spell. Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect, and may result in added Fatigue, the destruction of the Grimjelly, injury, and even death.

## Relics
**Relics** are items imbued with a magical spell or power. They do not cause Fatigue. Relics usually have a limited use, as well as a recharge condition. A few examples:

**Honeyclasp** , 3 charges. A rusted ring that shrinks the bearer to 6" tall. Recharge: place in a thimble-sized cup of royal jelly.

**Falconer's Friend** , 1 charge. A bolt-shaped wand carrying the _Haste_ spell. Recharge: fire from a crossbow and recover.

**Staff of Silence** , 1 charge. This blackened rod temporarily disables all magic within 50ft. Recharge: bathe in the light of a full moon.

**Leycap** , 1 use. Anyone ingesting this green-flecked mushroom loses a Fatigue, but is then required to make a WIL save to avoid its addictive properties. A fail leaves the PC deprived and unable to focus until they can eat another leycap, providing only a brief reprieve from the addiction.

## Mutations
[Mutations](/srd/magic/02-Mutations.md) are semi-permanent magical effects applied to the body of the user. They can occur by being exposed to raw magical forces without sufficient protection or by employing the services of a **Mutagenist**
