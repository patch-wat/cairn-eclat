# Blue
A noble, born in the lap of privilege and power. While not all nobles are wealthy, expectations are to act like it. Working with my hands is socially taboo, if not outright illegal.

Once, I wiled away the hours engaged in the genteel pursuits of

|3     |a Duelist | a dueling pistol (d4, loud). My sibling has the other, A lucky locket (_Shield_ 1/day)|

|3     |Lucid Dreaming | I know how to lucid dream and am inanely good at it|
|4     |Human Resources| Hirelings may use my WIL when making morale saves|
|5     |Misty Veil|I can create a small veil of mist around myself|
|6     |Thought Thief | When my attack deals max damage, I glimpse into the target's thoughts|
