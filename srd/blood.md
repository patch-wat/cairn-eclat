# Blood 
__Blood__ is your PCs social class. A combination of both their codified social estate and how they were raised. While sometimes correlated with raw wealth, this is not strictly true. The world has plenty enough destitute noble houses and wealthy criminal overlords. What __Blood__ instead indicates is a social culture that your character is fluent in as a result of their upbringing.

While Blood is important in Urban settings, it's much less so in rural settings and with traveling people.

Mechanically speaking, __Blood__ comes with a profession that your PC held before they began adventuring, a related set of starting gear, as well as a __Knack__, a special talent as a result of fortune, skill, or magical mutation.

Additionally, there, by default, reaction rolls you make for NPCs that share a __Blood__ with you add 1d4 (assuming your not actively trying to hide it). NPCs with sufficient reason to dislike your __Blood__ (for example, due to class conflict in the fiction) subtract 1d4 instead.

## The Colors of Blood
Each __Blood__ is identified by a specific color. They are meant to be both symbolic and relatively arbitrary. 

- Crimson: pauper and criminals. People that live hard lives and are accustomed to violence and struggle
- Clear: Effective outsiders. Clears have no stake in the class conflicts that define urban life. They're either from the countryside, are traveling folk, or are so ingrained in a neutral institution (such as the Crown or a religious sect) that it overshadows their real background.
- Green: Laborers and Artisans. Humble if ordinary folk. By far most of the folk in a given city are these sort of people.
- Silver: The burghers. Factory owners, entrepreneurs, and the "new rich". These folk are probably the most materially successful (perhaps even more so than Blue bloods). 
- Blue: Nobles and the politically privileged. The latest iteration of millennia old institutions. Most of the statues around the cities are relatives of these people.
