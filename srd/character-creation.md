# Character Creation
## Name your Character
A good name is important for figuring out who PC is. Either create your own or roll on the [table](#name-d20) for suggestions

## Blood
Next roll for, or choose, your PCs __Blood__, or social class, from the table below. This is important in not only figuring out what your PC has been up before he got started adventuring but also informs how he was raised. The NPCs of this game care deeply about Blood, especially if you have Blood in common. Tensions are high between the Bloods in this period.

Then roll a d20 or select a Profession. These come with some items that you still have from your old life. Add them to your [Inventory](#inventory)

Finally, circumstances or lineage has warped your body or soul from human standard (such that it exists), roll or select your [__Mutation__](/srd/magic/mutations.md)(d6) for your blood.

If none of the professions or knacks interest you, feel free to, with the help of The Warden, design your own.

#### Blood (2d6)

| | | | | |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :--: |
|    2-3    | 4-5  |   6-8   | 9-10 | 11-12      |
| [Crimson](/srd/bloods/crimson.md) | [Clear](/srd/bloods/clear.md) | [Green](/srd/bloods/green.md) | [Silver](/srd/bloods/silver.md) | [Blue](/srd/bloods/blue.md) |

## Character Traits and Appearance
Next, roll for the rest of your character's **traits** (appearance, speech, mannerisms, beliefs, reputation, etc.) on the [**Character Traits**](#character-traits-d10) tables."

Next, as long-term exposure to magic has irrevocably warped the biology of everybody in written history, you may roll up to 3 items on the [Magical Deformities Table](#magical-deformities-d20). Don't feel self-conscious, everybody has them and with the right decorations they might even be quite fetching.

Finally, roll for their **age** (2d20+10).

## Ability Scores
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:  
**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**. When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

 </summary>
 Ines rolls for her character's **STR**, resulting in a **2**, a **4**, and a **6**, totaling **12**. The next two ability rolls result in a **9** for **DEX** and a **13** for **WIL**. She decides to swap the **12** and the **9**, for a character with **9 STR**, **12 DEX** and **13** **WIL**.
</details>

## Hit Protection
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see [**Healing**](/srd/07-Core-Rules.md#healing)). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [**Scars**](/srd/cairn-srd.md#scars-1) table.

## Inventory
Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head). The backpack can also double as an emergency sleeping bag but only if emptied of its contents.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Warden's discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment.

### Starting Gear
Each player starts with
- 3d6 Gold Pieces (petty)
- Rations (3 uses)
- Lantern & Oil
- The items they still have from their old __Profession__
